# devin_program
## Overview

This repository contains learning materials and code samples developed for Devin to support his studies in **Data Structures**, **Algorithms**, and **Probability Theory**. The goal is to build strong computational and analytical thinking skills through hands-on coding practice and foundational theoretical concepts.

## Learning Focus

### ✅ Data Structures
- Arrays & Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Graphs
- Hash Maps and Sets

### ✅ Algorithms
- Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick)
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming Basics

### ✅ Probability Theory
- Basic Probability Concepts
- Conditional Probability
- Expected Value Calculations
- Random Simulations

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- Standard Libraries: `random`, `math`, `collections`
- (Optional) Jupyter Notebooks for interactive learning

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elikhan786/devin_program.git
